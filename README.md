# Group Assignment - Group 6

This repository contains scripts and assets for analyzing git commits, compiling the project at different commit points, and performing subsequent analyses. Below is an overview of each component in the repository.

## Repository Structure

- `commitExtraction.py`: A Python script that retrieves git commits and filters them based on issue lists provided in an Excel file.
- `assets/`: A folder containing the Excel file used by `commitExtraction.py` to filter commits.
- `compile.py`: A Python script that uses `compile.sh` to compile the project for each commit retrieved by `commitExtraction.py`.
- `compile.sh`: A shell script called by `compile.py` to compile the project and generate JAR files.
- `outputs/commits_jar_files`: A folder where the JAR files generated by `compile.py` are stored.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies required for the Python scripts in this project.
- `commits_analysis.ipynb`: Python scripts that perform graphical analysis using data generated by `commitExtraction.py`.
- `acdc_script.txt`: A python script that generates ACSC rsf files dynamically based on the commits data provided in.
## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Git installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Filtering Commits

Run the `commitExtraction.py` script to filter commits based on the issues listed in the Excel file located in the `assets/` folder:

```bash
python commitExtraction.py
```

### Compiling Projects

After filtering the commits, use `compile.py` to compile the project at each commit point, One has to provide cloneed repo path to execute it:

```bash
python compile.py
```

This script calls `compile.sh` to handle the actual compilation process and saves the generated JAR files in the `outputs/commits_jar_files` folder.
